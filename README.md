# Installation Tutorial

System Requirements:

```
Node.js 18.17 or later.
macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.
```

You can make sure you have node 18.17.0 by using `nvm` , install `npm install nvm`:
```bash
❯ nvm current
v18.16.0
``

If your current npm is less than 18.17.0 then you can install the latest with 
```bash
❯ nvm install 18.17.0
```
